# oakpubsub
A partial [gcloud-node](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gcloud-node) (google cloud) pubsub wrapper with bluebird promises, in functional style. Only does minimally what we need, no guarantees expressed or implied. Pull Requests for expanded functions/features are welcome.

See tests for usage.

Use care when doing mass deletes of topics or subscriptions, an incorrect regular expression could destroy data. It would be nice if google pubsub supported namespaces to avoid potential clobbering.

Tested with node v4 LTS
